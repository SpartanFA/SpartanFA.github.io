							<p>People Vs. Everything... is a prophunt ripoff.</p>
							<p>Basically, it is a Multiplayer shooter with two teams, "props" and "hunters". The "props" will transform into various objects on the map and try to blend into the surroundings, while the hunters will use Guns and other special abilties to try to find the hidden props.</p>
							<p>I have been working on this project for over 6 years now, using mostly Unreal Blueprints to engineer out the game. However, note all the 3d models, UI elements, and animations weren't made by me (I am not an artist), they were purchased on UE4 store.</p>
							<p>After working on this thing for 6 years there are a lot of special features. For example, I have a store system so "props" and "hunters" can purchase equipment and abilities with points they earn. I also have multiple gamemodes, ranging all the way to gamemodes that have nothing to do with prophunt. "GunGame" is a free-for-all gamemode where every player fights everyone else; for every kill the player receives a new weapon, the first player to earn all the weapons wins the match.</p>
							<p>Lastly, we have some really interesting integrations with various APIs, I successfully integrated the Twitch API, the Discord API, and finally the Epic Online Services API which allows us to implement cross-platform support, voice chat support, and anti-cheat support.</p>
							<p>The game is almost done, but not quite... I need to clean up the UI and build out a website. If you want a demo please reach out to this email: bewerner23@gmail.com for a Steam code.</p>
